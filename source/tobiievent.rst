  This workshop is designed to equip researchers with the skills needed to make an eye tracking experiment in PsychoPy using Tobii eye tracking equipment. The workshop will be divided into two goals; the morning session will be tailored towards a general introduction to PsychoPy, making experiments and getting started with inbuilt eye tracking functionality. The afternoon will be focused time allowing researchers to start creating their own eye tracking experiment- with the PsychoPy and Tobii team on hand to assist! Attendees can either bring their own Tobii or use Tobii equipment available in the session. Tickets will be limited, and will cost £150 + VAT per person. `Tickets can be purchases through the University of Nottingham Store <https://store.nottingham.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/conferences/schools-and-departments/psychology/psychopy-tobii-eyetracking>`_.

  What do I need in advance?
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Our ultimate goal is for researchers to leave this session with an eyetracking experiment that they can take back to their lab. So, in advance of the session we'de advise that you plan your goals, and prepare your stimuli to use in your experiment. If you aren't at the point of having stimuli ready to go, bring along placeholder stimuli so that you can make the framework ready to adapt later on! 

  Checklist:

  * Laptop/Computer
  * Tobii (if you want to use your own!)
  * Stimuli/task materials you will need to make your experiment


  How can I purchase tickets?
