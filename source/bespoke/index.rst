Bespoke events and consultancy
-------------------------------

We now offer a range of consultancy services to help you and your research team develop bespoke tasks and training events. The services we provide range from departmental training to commissioned task creation. To enquire regarding these services please contact consultancy@opensciencetools.org 


What can we offer?
-------------------

We can be quite flexible in what we offer, but to give you an idea of what is possible:

*	**Task creation** Need a task creating? Our team of experts can help create a task to fit your brief.
*	**Debugging assistance** Have you developed a task that needs a few tweaks you are stuck on? In general we try to offer as much support for this for free via the `forum <discourse.psychopy.org>`_    but if you would prefer, we can help directly.
*	**Small group training** If you would like a departmenal workshop tailored to a broad audience (assuming begginer knowledge of PsychoPy) we offer 3Hr sessions at a small fee of Â£100 per session. Alternatively, if you and your lab group would like to learn about specific aspects of PsychoPy (for example learn how to create a specific type of task), we can tailor something for you.
