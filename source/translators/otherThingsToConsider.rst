Other things to consider
===============================

These are not fundamental to the process, but worth thinking about

1a: Working from the *dev* branch
----------------------------------

- Earlier, I said translators should work from the *release* branch
- But once a localization is finished, it might be better to start working from the *dev* branch
- Two week prior to any **major** release, there is a *feature freeze*

  - This means that contributors have to stop adding new features so that *science team* members at *Open Science Tools* can test the new features added to that point.
  
    - This minimizes the potential for bugs in the release 
- There's an opportunity here

1b: Getting translations in with the new release
--------------------------------------------------

- During feature freeze, the maintainers can notify translators of the new release
- Translators can get in and translate (off the *dev* branch, where the new features are) so that the language in question is fully updated exactly when the new major release comes out 

  - This means that there's no awkward period when languages aren't up to date with the new release 
- This should be a team decision reached only after a localization is relatively complete
