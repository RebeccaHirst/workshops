.. _other things to consider:

A strategy for later on
===============================

- This is not fundamental to the process, but worth thinking about
- If working in a team, you will need to plan this together as a team

Work from the *dev* branch
----------------------------------

- As stated a few times before, translators should work from the *release* branch

  - at least initially 
- But once a localization is finished, it might be better to start working from the *dev* branch
- Why?

  - Two week prior to any **major** release, there is a *feature freeze*

    - contributors have to stop adding new features so that *science team* members at *Open Science Tools* can test the new features added to that point (minimizing the potential for bugs in the release)
- There's an opportunity here...

Getting translations in with the new release
--------------------------------------------------

- During feature freeze, the maintainers could potentially notify translators of the new release
- Then, translators could get in and translate off the *dev* branch, where the new features are, so that the language in question is fully updated exactly when the new major release comes out 

  - This means that there's no awkward period when languages aren't up to date with the new release 

When and how to set this up
------------------------------

- This should be a team decision reached only after a localization is relatively complete
- The maintainers would also need to know which languages are adopting this strategy so that they can notify the translators of the feature freeze
