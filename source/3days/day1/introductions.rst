About the workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not aiming to teach you all of PsychoPy

Hopefully give you some ideas about what's possible



Getting to know PsychoPy
============================

What is PsychoPy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's `Psychology software in Python`

PsychoPy is several things:
    * a library for use in Python scripts
    * an editor including Python to edit scripts
    * an application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for building experiments

It's, itself, entirely written in Python

Goal of PsychoPy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim is to enable scientists to run as wide a range of experiments as possible, as easily
as possible, with standard computer hardware.

A single piece of software:
    - precise enough for psychophysics
    - intuitive enough for undergraduate psychology
    - flexible enough for everything else
    - capable of running studies in the lab or online

Choice of interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's hard to make something easy enough for undergrads and novices but flexible enough for everything else.

PsychoPy provides two main options, for programmers and non-programmers, but there are also ways to combine the two.

PsychoPy is written in the Python programming language

   The Coder view is used to create experiments from Python scripts

.. figure:: /_images/builderView2020.png

   The Builder view is used to create experiments visually

Why do people *Code*?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: build

    - To implement more complex experimental designs/procedures(?)
    - To break out of the current trial structure or hardware drawing loop cycle
    - To know exactly what the code is doing(?)
    - To program things that aren't psychology experiments. (e.g. stats, simulations, analyses etc.)

Why do people *Build*?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: build

    - It is far faster to develop experiments!
    - You can still understand (and build on) your experiment next year
    - You'll probably have fewer bugs
    - Code Components can be used in nearly all places where Builder isn't enough
    - Your Builder experiment will also compile to a web (JS/HTML) experiment!

What do **we** do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I (Becca) and Jon still use both Builder and Coder on a regular basis.

My experiments I are almost always in Builder, with added Code Components. I don't ever break out and switch to pure code. I use code for other things (e.g. making my 'conditions' .csv files, making stimuli)
