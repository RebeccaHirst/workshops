Launching your studies on Pavlovia
=================================

The plan
-----------------

We are going to practice what we learnt in builder, but focus on getting online. 

We will start with a VERY simple task (similar to what we have already been working on, but stripped back) then we will introduce some things that might not work smoothly online.


The task
-----------------
A simple "targetHitTask".

Present a target in a set number of locations (in a random order) and click them as fast as they can. 

On each trial, we will gather responses from the mouse.

The participant should only be able to click the target.

The image should stay on the screen untill clicked.

Add more routines
-----------------

Add some instructions and a thank-you message - then let's get this online!

NB: when deciding what kind of response to use to end a routine (e.g. instructions) remember this is going online, and not all devices have keyboards...

Push it online
-----------------

To load the task to pavlovia.org we can either use the "run online" or the "sync to pavlovia" icons. The former will then try to run our task in the browser. For now let's use sync.

Next we create a pavlovia project, select what group we load the project to and add details on the task.

If we then go to our Experiments in the pavlovia Dashboard, we should see our task uploaded. We can see that currently it is inactive, change the status to pilot and then click "pilot" next to the View code option.

There we have it! our first basic task in pavlovia!! 

In reality, things are not always smooth (but we are working on it!). Next we will build on this task to cover some tips in :ref:`debuggingOnline`
