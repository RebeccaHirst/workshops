About
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thank you for your interest in attending our PsychoPy workshops!

We can be quite flexible with what we cover in these sessions but we will keep the themes quite broad to facilitate most attendees. Typically the timetable with appear as follows:

What do I need to know in advance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only base knowledge we will assume for this workshop can be learnt from this `15 minute video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIw1e1GqroQ>`_ .

What technology and/or software will I need to make the most of the workshops?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We require attendees to download a recent version of PsychoPy and register for a free Pavlovia account, this allows attendees to follow along with the tutorials and create tasks as we go.

We run the workshops using a combination of zoom and slack. The slack channel is designed to encourage interaction throughout and provides a few benefits:
    - This provides a location to ask questions throughout (for those apprehensive to use the mic).
    - Questions are monitored by other PsychoPy team members, meaning you can get feedback from the whole team.
    - The conversations are archived, so you can come back to the answers to yours and others questions later.
