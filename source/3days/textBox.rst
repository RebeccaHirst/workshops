Typed responses
=================
PsychoPy now has an editable text box component to get typed responses. It is under development, but worth touching on.

textBox
----------------------------------
The texbox component is very similar to the text stimulus, except that we can make it 'editable'

Exercise
----------------------------------
We are going to make a digit span task. Participants will see 3 numbers and then be asked to type their response. We need:

- A routine to show the digits one by one in a random order
- A routine to gather the responses. Participants type a response and click a button to end the routine.
- Both of these routines to repeat 5 times 

What next?
----------------------------------
