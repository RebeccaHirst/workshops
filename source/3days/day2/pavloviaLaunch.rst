Launching your studies on Pavlovia
=================================

Launching studies on pavlovia
-----------------------------

To load the task to pavlovia.org we can either use the "run online" or the "sync to pavlovia" icons. The former will then try to run our task in the browser. For now let's use sync.

Next we create a pavlovia project, select what group we load the project to and add details on the task.

If we then go to our Experiments in the pavlovia Dashboard, we should see our task uploaded. We can see that currently it is inactive, change the status to pilot and then click "pilot" next to the View code option.

In reality, things may not always translate online smoothly (but we are working on it!).Let's talk about how to get online confidently and some tips for translating experiments online in :ref:`debuggingOnline`
