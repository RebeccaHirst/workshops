Launching a more complex study on Pavlovia
===========================================

Putting our task online
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the tasks that we need to push from PsychoPy to Pavlovia are quite complex. In general, if you are going online with your study - we *really* recommend pushing little and often to avoid issues getting online. Let's try and push our Posner online together to practice :ref:`pavloviaLaunch`.

.. _pavloviaDashboard:

Finding your experiment on Pavlovia
------------------------------------

Once we have synced our project we can check the project info to quickly explore the project online.

You can also find your experiment on Pavlovia via the dashboard > experiments. This is where you can view your experiments, check if you have credits etc.

The Experiment page
------------------------------------

By clicking on one of your experiments, you can see the details of that project, set the state of your experiment and access the data.

Finding the data
------------------------------------
You can save your output in 2 ways:

*	**.csv** format will store a .csv and log file that van be accessed via "View Code <>" > "data"
*	**Database** will store a single file with all participants appended to a single file (this will not be stored int the project repository, so if you later make your project public the data will not be public).
