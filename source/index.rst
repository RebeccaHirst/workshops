Open Science Tools official workshops
`````````````````````````````````````````````````


There are many resources to help you learn the various aspects of PsychoPy (and most of them are free!)

For users that have a budget, and want some direct training from the Open Science Tools team (who create PsychoPy), we now run frequent 3-day workshops with a range of topics, a range of timezones and a range of durations. You can read 
`about our 3 day workshops here <3days/index.html>`_

Alternatively, we will now be running shorter 3-hour introductions to PsychoPy. You can read
`about our 3 hour workshops here <3hrs/index.html>`_


We were planning also to run a new modular Summer School, called :ref:`pampr`.
We'll be monitoring the situation to see whether that can run either remotely
or in-person.

PaMPR (Programming and Methods in Psychology Research)
-----------------------------------------------------------

**2021 dates To Be Confirmed**

This is a new thing! It's a joint venture with Nottingham trent University.
I'm afraid we don't have the draft programme in place yet but the
general idea is to create a 5 day modular summer school. There will be a number of sessions 
running continuously on the main programming languages:

- Python and PsychoPy
- R 
- Matlab

as well as various specialist methods sections such as:

- EEG
- eye-tracking
- web experiments
- ...

The whole thing will be more modular, so you can drop into whichever sessions you want
the most. We hope it will offer a richer learning environment than we can provide with the
PsychoPy team on its own.

We'll probably finish with a day of mini-conference for people to share methods new(ish) they're
developing that others might find interesting.
