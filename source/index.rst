About
------------------

There are many resources to help you learn the various aspects of PsychoPy (and most of them are free!)

For users that have a budget, and want some direct training from the Open Science Tools team (who create PsychoPy), we now run frequent `3 day workshops here <3days/index.html>`_ with a range of topics and timezones.

Alternatively, we are trying out some shorter `3 hour introductory sessions <3hrs/index.html>`_ which can also be booked on a departmental bases through contacting us.
