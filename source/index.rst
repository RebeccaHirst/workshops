About
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many resources to help you learn the various aspects of PsychoPy (and most of them are free!)

For users that have a budget, and want some direct training from the Open Science Tools team (who create PsychoPy), we now run frequent `3 day workshops here <3days/index.html>`_ with a range of topics and timezones.

Alternatively, we are trying out some shorter `3 hour intrpoductory sessions <3hrs/index.html>`_ which can also be booked on a departmental bases through contacting us.



We were planning also to run a new modular Summer School, called :ref:`pampr`.
We'll be monitoring the situation to see whether that can run either remotely
or in-person.

PaMPR (Programming and Methods in Psychology Research)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**2021 dates To Be Confirmed**

This is a new thing! It's a joint venture with Nottingham trent University.
I'm afraid we don't have the draft programme in place yet but the
general idea is to create a 5 day modular summer school. There will be a number of sessions 
running continuously on the main programming languages:

- Python and PsychoPy
- R 
- Matlab

as well as various specialist methods sections such as:

- EEG
- eye-tracking
- web experiments
- ...

The whole thing will be more modular, so you can drop into whichever sessions you want
the most. We hope it will offer a richer learning environment than we can provide with the
PsychoPy team on its own.

We'll probably finish with a day of mini-conference for people to share methods new(ish) they're
developing that others might find interesting.
