About 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We typically deliver these sessions in a 3 hour format, and aim to cover 3 broad topics - in reality, we tend to tailor what we talk about depending on questions fromt he audience!

Our 3hr sessions are designed to give a *broad* introduction to using PsychoPy, we aim to make materials useful for beginners but also include useful tips and tricks for those already familiar with PsychoPy. We deliver our 3hr workshops in "open" format, meaning **anyone can attend for free**, we advertise events on eventbrite and anyone can register.

If you want a *departmental session* we charge a small fee (Â£100) - please contact workshops@opensciencetools.org to enquire.

What can I do to prepare?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend watching this `15 minute video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIw1e1GqroQ>`_  in advance of the session, this can get you up to speed on the materials we cover in the workshop. We believe very much in **learning by doing** our workshops work best if attendees follow along with making an experiment on their own computer whilst we talk through it's creation. 

- Please make sure that you have a `recent version of PsychoPy installed <https://www.psychopy.org/download.html>`_
- Make sure that you have `registered for a free pavlovia.org account <https://pavlovia.org/>`_
- We stream our sessions via Zoom
- It can be helpful, though not essential, to have 2 monitors (one for watching the session and one for creating the experiment)
