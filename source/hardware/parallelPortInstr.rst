Sending triggers via a Parallel Port (or USB)
=================================================

Step one: Set up your Parallel Port component in Builder
-------------------------------------------------------------

PsychoPy has a Parallel Port component in Builder view. This can be found in the I/O component drop down. This component supports both traditional parallel ports and USB devices.

* Add your Parallel Port component to your routine in the same way that you would with any other component. We're now going to set the component up to run the way we want it to. 
* In the example below, let's imagine we want a trigger to be sent to our EEG recording device when a stimulus appears on screen: 

	.. image:: /_images/parallel1.png

* So our component is added and we've set it up the way we want. We now need to make sure that the trigger is going to be sent to the right place! 
* To do this, we're firstly going to check our port address.
* We can check this on our computer (not within PsychoPy itself) by navigating to: Device Manager > Ports > Find the parallel port that you are using from the drop down > Right-click Properties > Resources tab > The port's address is under the Settings header.

.. note::  
	The **address** of the port is not the same as the **name** of the port. For instance, the name of the port could be "LPT 1" but the address might be "0378". 
* Now, in the hardware tab of the parallel port component in PsychoPy, select the correct parallel port address:

	.. image:: /_images/parallel2.png

* If you do not see the correct address in the drop down, in PsychoPy navigate to: File > Preferences > Hardware > Parallel Ports > Click the "..." icon > Click the New Item icon > Enter the parallel port address > OK > Apply:

	.. image:: /_images/parallel3.png

.. note:: 
	The parallel port address is usually a hexadecimal address. We tell PsychoPy to read it as such by prefixing with "0x". So if your port address appears in Device Manager as "0378-037F" for example, in PsychoPy this would be written as "0x0378".

* The correct port address will now appear in the drop down menu in the Hardware tab of the Parallel Port component. 


Step two: Make sure you have the correct drivers installed
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using a Mac, it's recommended that you skip this step. For Windows users, a common error when trying to communicate via a Parallel Port component is that certain drivers are not found. We're going to pre-empt that error by downloading and installing the correct drivers now.

* Download the InpOutx64.dll and InpOutx32.dll files from `here <https://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/>`_. You need to use the "Binaries only - x86 & x64 DLLs and libs" option under the Download Links subheading near the bottom of the page:

	.. image:: /_images/parallel4.png

* When downloaded, find and extract the .zip folder. This will be called something like "InpOutBinaries_1501.zip".
* In the unzipped folder, find and copy the files "inpoutx64.dll" and "inpoutx64.lib" from the x64 folder, and then the file "inpout32.h" from the Win32 folder. Place a copy of all of these in the **same folder as your PsychoPy experiment file (the one with the .psyexp filetype)**.
* Restart PsychoPy (save your experiment first!)


Step three: Test your triggers
-------------------------------------------------------------

* To check that everything works, we recommend that you set up a very basic experiment that looks similar to this:

	.. image:: /_images/parallel5.png

* Turn on your EEG recording device and start recording as you would in your actual experiment, and just check that you see triggers coming through. 
* It's a good idea at this point to also check the timing of your stimulus presentation and your triggers using, for example, a photodiode for visual stimuli. 
* Doing these checks with a very basic experiment just means that you don't accidentally change something on your real experiment file that you don't want to, and also means you don't have to disable components or sit through lots of instructions etc!


If there is a problem - We want to know!
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you have followed the steps above and are having an issue with triggers, please post details of this on the `PsychoPy Forum <https://discourse.psychopy.org/>`_.

We are constantly looking to update our documentation so that it's easy for you to use PsychoPy in the way that you want to. Posting in our forum allows us to see what issues users are having, offer solutions, and to update our documentation to hopefully prevent those issues from occurring again!
