  This workshop will cover the basics of getting started with PsychoPy Builder to make experiments. The session is suitable for beginners with little experience of PsychoPy. Topics will include:

  - Presenting stimuli (e.g. images, text)
  - Gathering keyboard responses (measuring response times and accuracy)
  - Block designs and counterbalancing
