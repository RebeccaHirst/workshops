  **When?** August 7th, 15:30 - 17:00 (UK time)

  **Where?** Virtual (Zoom)

  **What will I learn?** This workshop will cover the basics of getting started with PsychoPy Builder to make experiments. The session is suitable for beginners with little experience of PsychoPy. Topics will include:

  - Presenting stimuli (e.g. images, text)
  - Gathering keyboard responses (measuring response times and accuracy)
  - Block designs and counterbalancing

  **Why attend a workshop?** Unlike a YouTube video or webinar, this is a "hands on" learning experience with a member of our team to guide you. You make an experiment at the same time as us, you can ask questions in real-time. 

  **How can I register?** Book a ticket or apply for a waiver.
