  **When?** August 21st, 15:30 - 17:00 (UK time)

  **Where?** Virtual (Zoom)

  **What will I learn?** This workshop will introduce you to how to run experiments online with Pavlovia.org. 

  **We will assume some knowledge with building experiments in PsychoPy if you have never made an experiment in PsychoPy we recommend attending our session on** :ref:`creating experiments <topicsCreatingExps>`. The topics covered in this session will include:

  * Getting your experiment to Pavlovia.org
  * Daisy chaining your online experiment with other platforms 
  * Special considerations for online experiments (e.g. how to control stimulus size)

  **Why attend a workshop?** Unlike a YouTube video or webinar, this is a "hands on" learning experience with a member of our team to guide you. You make an experiment at the same time as us, you can ask questions in real-time. 

  **How can I register?** Book a ticket or apply for a waiver.
