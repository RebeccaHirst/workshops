Running online studies
=================================

Let's just take one of our tasks from earlier and try to run it online.

We'll have to see what goes wrong!

Some things to look at:

    - making sure that responses work (mouse not keyboard?)
    - making the study active
    - checking data files are as expected
    - what about our code components?
