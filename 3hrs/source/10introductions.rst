About me
==========

**Jon Peirce:**
    * Vision scientist at University of Nottingham, UK
    * Principal creator/maintainer of PsychoPy

**Credits:**
    - many other people have contributed to the PsychoPy project (Jeremy Gray, Mike MacAskill, Richard HÃ¶chenberger, Sol Simpson being the biggest contributors)

    - Nottingham University have been paying my salary while PsychoPy was written

    - Wellcome Trust recently gave us a grant to improve this a LOT

About the workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not aiming to teach you all of PsychoPy

Hopefully give you some ideas about what's possible



Getting to know PsychoPy
============================

What is PsychoPy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's `Psychology software in Python`

PsychoPy is several things:

    - a library for use in Python scripts
    - an editor including Python to edit scripts
    - an application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for building experiments

It's, itself, entirely written in Python

Goal of PsychoPy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim is to enable scientists to run as wide a range of experiments as possible, as easily
as possible, with standard computer hardware.

A single piece of software:
    - precise enough for psychophysics
    - intuitive enough for undergraduate psychology
    - flexible enough for everything else
    - capable of running studies in the lab or online

Choice of interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's hard to make something easy enough for undergrads and novices but flexible enough for everything else.

PsychoPy provides two main options, for programmers and non-programmers, but there are also ways to combine the two.

PsychoPy is written in the Python programming language

   The Coder view is used to create experiments from Python scripts

   The Builder view is used to create experiments visually

Why do people *Code*?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: build

    - To implement more complex experimental designs/procedures(?)
    - To break out of the current trial structure
    - To break out of the hardware drawing loop cycle
    - To know exactly what the code is doing(?)
    - To program things that aren't psychology experiments. (e.g. stats, simulations, analyses etc.)

Why do people *Build*?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: build

    - It is far faster to develop experiments!
    - You can still understand (and build on) your experiment next year
    - You'll probably have fewer bugs
    - Code Components can be used in nearly all places where Builder isn't enough
    - In the future your Builder experiment will also compile to a web (JS/HTML) experiment!

What does **Jon** do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I still use both Builder and Coder on a regular basis.

My experiments I are almost always in Builder, with added Code Components. I don't ever break out and switch to pure code.
